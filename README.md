# Dropdown Component

## what could i have done better?

-   Use storybook to document the project like I did in this example https://github.com/maatheusgouveia/dropdown-component

-   Light and dark theme support recognizing user defined setting

-   Custom icon on button

-   Add icons support on each menu item
